### **Instructions:**
**Warning:** Do NOT run the program twice in a row on your data. It will overwrite the answer key and you'll lose all original names of your data. This is also why it's important to back it up before you begin
**  
  
  
1. BACKUP ALL IMAGES. This script works **100%** of the time on my computer, but everyone's computers are set up a little differently, so you should do this to avoid losing your data. Copy the folder that has the folders of images, and put it somewhere safe in a new "Backup" folder. Should something go wrong, this will allow you to still do the randomization by hand.
2. Download  ```image_rename.py``` from this repository
3. Open your downloads folder, right click ```image_rename.py``` and ```copy file path```
4. Open a ```terminal``` or ```command prompt``` window
5. Type ```python PATH_YOU_COPIED``` where ```PATH_YOU_COPIED``` is the filepath you copied. You can paste it using ```ctrl + v``` or if that doesn't work, ```ctrl + shift + v```. Press enter.
6. The program will start to run. Open ```file explorer and navigate to the folder that contains the other folders which hold the images. **NOTE:** the files must be set up this way. The images cannot all be in the same folder. There must be one folder that contains all the others, where "all the others" means the folders that hold the images.
7. Click the bar at the top of ```file explorer``` that tells you which folder you are in. This will expand it to the full filepath, and highlight it. Copy this path.
8. Paste this new filepath into the python program, and hit enter.
9. Barring any errors python spat at you, everything has been succesfully renamed! See the answer key on (realistically) your desktop, or the same directory the main folder (that holds everything else) was kept.
 

###  **Troubleshooting:**
1. ``` python : The term 'python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.```
  
  Make sure you have python installed. If you do, this likely means you need to add python to your path variable (you don't need to insall anything new if you already have python)

2. "I can't paste anything in the terminal!"  
 Try using ```ctrl + shift + v```
